       				        1. MAGNETISM 

Magnetics fields: Tool used to describe distrubution of magnetic force in the space around a 
			magnetic object (We call the diagrams B-fields)
			
Traits of magnetic fields
	- Any two abritrary B-fields will never intersect
	- B-fields flow into the south and out the north in a magnet
	- Different poles attract, Identical poles repell
	
Magnetic permeability: how much a ferromagnetic material increases the magnetic field when placed inside a thing. 

Domain theory: All magnets are made up of smaller and rotatable magnets (Dipoles)
		-> Large dipoles are created from smaller ones
		-> The magnetic field is also called a magnetic domain
Implications of domain theory
 Magnetic induction
 -> Any ferromagnetic objects's magnetism increases the more dipoles face the same direction
 Breaking a magnet
 -> snapping a magnet in half will yield two magnets
 Demagnetization
 -> Dropping or heating a magnet can cause dipoles to become misaligned
 Magnetic saturation
 -> Any ferromagnetic material has a maxiumum magnetic permeability

	                            2. ELECTROMAGNETISM
RIGHT HAND RULE #1 : Magnetic fields around a conductor
derived from Oersted's principle: Conductors produce rings of magnetic energy when current is ran through them

rule: make thumbs up
	thumb is direction of current flow
	fingers are direction of magnetic field
	
RIGHT HAND RULE #2: Magnetic fields around a solenoid
derived from thin air

Calculations >>> 
1. Magnetic field strenght of straight conductor: B = (μ)(I/2𝝅r) 
r = perpendicular distance from conductor
μ = magnetic permeability of substance

2. Magnetic field strenght of center of current loop: B = (μ)(NI/2r)
r = radius of loop
N = number of loops

3. Magnetic field of solenoid: B = (μ)(NI/L)
L = length of solenoid
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
				3. INDUCED CURRENTS 
				
Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction: A magnatic field that is moving or changing intensity near a conductor induces current flow in the conductor

Lenz's law: If faraday's law occurs in a coil, the direction of the induced current is opposed to the change that produced it

		            3.1 MOTORS AND APPLICATIONS

The motor principle: Two magnetic fieds interact with one another to produce a force. 
 -> RIGHT HAND RULE: 3 
	Thumb = direction of current
	Palm = direction of force
	Fingers = direction of magnetic field 

AC vs DC motors: DC needs SPLIT RING
		 AC needs SLIP RING
