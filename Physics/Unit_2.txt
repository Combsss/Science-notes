       				        1. VECTORS	
A vector can be used to represent DISPLACEMENT(d) or VELOCITY(v)
-> These vectors can be decomposed into two seperate vectors, for the x and y dimension

d -> Δdₓ, Δdᵧ   (Total displacement -> Displacement in x,  Displacement in y)
v -> Δvₓ, Δvᵧ   (Total velocity -> Velocity in x direction, Velocity in y direction)       
 	      
*Δvₓ and Δvᵧ are independent of each other: Ex, throwing a ball at vₓ will not affect vᵧ

  				2. SOLVING FOR VECTORS      
 
2.1 Component method
-> General idea: Deconstruct each vector into it's x and y vectors, then sum up all the x and ys
		 To obtain a total x and total y vector
		 -> The final vectors are arranged into a right angled triangle to solve for 
		 the resultant vector
		
2.2 Trigonometric method
-> Use trig identities and Cosin/Sin law to solve for the resultant vector
(Most useful when diagram is already triangular)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			           3. RELATIVE VELOCITY
For two objects A and B with velocities Va and Vb from a common stationary frame of reference 

The velocity of the object A relative to the object B is: Vab = Va - Vb
The velocity of the object B relative to that of object a is: Vba = Vb - Va
Therefore, Vab = -Vba

Assuming the same two objects, if the frame of reference is set on either A or B, we have
(Frame of reference on A) -> Va = 0, Vb = Va-Vb
(Frame of reference on B) -> Vb = 0, Va = Vb-Va

*Relative velocity questions are solved by setting up a vector diagram 
-> Usually in the shape of a triangle with a missing side (The resultant vector)
and solving for the resultant vector using pythagorean theorem, or cos/sin law

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			           4. Projectile motion
Most important concept: Law of orthagonal vectors
-> Orthagonal vectors are independant of each other

Therefore we can solve for projectile motion by solving for the x and y dimensions SEPERATELY 
and using kinematic equations

(Basically a combination of everything learnt up till now) 

Projectile motion can get complicated, so a step by step is helpful


1. Resolve or break the motion into horizontal and vertical components along the x- and y-axes
2. Solve for the unknowns in the two separate motions—one horizontal and one vertical.2. 
3. Recombine the two motions to find the total displacement s and velocity v
4. Write a therefore statement and check your sig figs so you don't lose communication marks!
