1. 
     Newton's 1st law: Stationary objects stay stationary, moving objects keep moving unless
     			 acted upon
     Newton's 2nd law: F = ma (Force equals to mass times acceleration)
     Newton's 3rd law: For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction
     
2. 
a = Δv/Δt
  = (8.0m/s) / (2.0s)
  = 4m/s^2
  
F = ma
  = (40kg)(4m/s^2)
  = 160 N
  = 1.6 x 10^2 N

3. 
Δd = v₁^2Δt +(1/2)aΔt^2
 a = 2(Δd - Δtv₁)/t^2
   = 2[1.9 - 1.8s(0.000m/s)]/(1.8s)^2
   = 0.56m/s^2
 
F = ma
159N = m(0.56m/s^2)
   m = 283.9285714kg
     = 2.8 x 10^2 kg

4. 
Fₜ = ma
Fₐ - F(friction) = (20kg)(0.000m/s^2)
F(friction) = -Fₐ
	    = -50N
	    
5. 
a) The two masses are connected so acceleration is constant through the system
     a = -9.81m/s
b) Fₜ = Fₘ₂
   Fₜ = (m₂)(a)
      = (0.5kg)(-9.81m/s^2)
      = -4.905N
      = -4.9N

6. 
a) F = ma
  120N = (11.0kg+10.0kg+6kg)(a)
     a = 4.44 m/s^2
b) F = ma
     = (6kg)(4.44m/s^2)
     = 26.7 N
c) F = ma
     =
