DIGESTIVE ORGANS

The 4 steps of food processing
- Ingestion -> Mouth and esophagus 
- Digestion -> Stomach
- Absorption -> Large/Small intestines
- Defecation -> Rectum

Digestion (In order) 
1. MOUTH:
- Saliva = water + enzymes
- Mouth is site of both mechanical and chemical digestion
-> Saliva mixed with food is called a BOLUS

Swallow reflex -> soft palete prevents bolus from entering nasal cavity, tongue prevents bolus from re-entering mouth, larynx moves with the epiglotis to prevent food from entering lungs
Bolus passes through the PHARYNX (throat)

2. Esophagus 
Involuntary contractions called PERISTALISIS moves food down

3. Stomach
Enters through gastroesophageal (Cardiac) sphincter

Layers of the stomach (From out to in)
1. Muscularis layer: 3 layers of muscle arranged in different orientations to mix food
2. Submucosa layer: nerves + blood vessels that instruct the stomach and inform the brain
3. Mucosa layer: Contains cells that make gastric juices

*The liquid mixture in the stomach is called CHYME 

Composition of gastric juices
- Mucus: Protects stomach lining
- Strong acid (HCI): Kills bacteria and activates pepsinogen into pepsin enzyme 
- Pepsinogen/pepsin: Enzyme that digests protein into amino acids 

Exits through pyloric sphincter

4. Small intestines 

Site of absorption and chemical digestion

Composed of 3 sections

1. Duodenum[
	- Chemical digestion ONLY
	
Accesory organs are used

- LIVER
Uses bile produced by liver. (Released directly into duodenum)
Bile helps fat digestion by emulsifying itself with the fat, creating a higher surface area.
Extra bile is stored in the gallbladder .

- PANCREAS
Exocrine function: Produces more enzymes, including
	Pancreatic amylase (Breaks down starch) -> maltose 
	Trypsin (Breaks down protein) -> Ammino acid
	Lipases (Breaks down fats) -> Glycerol + fatty acid
	
Endocrine function: produces hormones
	Insulin and glucagon (Control blood sugar levels)* Insulin allows glucose into cells 
	
	
The duodenum also produces hormones
	- ChloeCystokinin (CCK) -> Tells pancreas that enzymes are needed
	- pro-secretin /secretin -> Acidic chyme activates pro-secretin to tell liver to make more bile and enzymes 
		*Secretin also signals the pancreas to release bicarbonate ions to neutralise the acid in the stomach, and controls the pyrolic sphyincter 
		*Reduced PH level inactivates pepsin 
	
	
List of Enzymes
- Bile: Emulsifies fat 
- Secretin: 
- Lipases: Decomposes fats into glycerin and fatty acid
- Trypsin: Breaks down protein

2. ILEUM AND JEJUNUM
- Villi and microvilli increase surface area for absorption

Absorption:
- Passive transport
	Occurs from high to low concentrations
	Water-soluble nutrients can be diffused this way *called facilliatated diffusion
	
- Active transport
	Occurs from low to high concentration 
	Fat-soluble nutriends must be diffused this way
	Certain proteins help the nutrients enter the cell *Thus requires energy (ATP)



3. LARGE INTESTINES 
Absorbs 
- Vitamine
- Water
- Minerals 

4. RECTUM
- Internal anal sphincter (Automatic)
- External anal spphyncter (Controlled)
