METABOLISM

CELLULAR RESPIRATION: The process of accessing energy from food  
C6H2O6 -> 6CO2 + 6H2O plus ENERGY 


Key terms{
	- |Alimentary canal|: The entire digestive system that comes in contact with food
	- |Chemical digestion|: The process of digestion by hydrolysis 
	- |Hydrolysis|: The process in which macromolecules are broken down with water. Uses enzymes as catalyst 
	- |Mechanical digestion|: Chewing
	- |Metabolism|: The sum total of all chemical reactions occuring in an organism
	- |Essential nutrient|: A nutrient that cannot be made by the human body
	- |Polypeptide|: Chains of animo acid held together by peptide bonds 
	- |Hormones|: Chemical messangers that allow communication between organs 

}

Nutrients: Necessary chemicals{

Important MACRONUTRIENTS{
	- Carbohydrates (Glucose)[
	
Monosaccharides: Single ring (C6H12O6) 

1. Glucose
2. Galactose
3. Fructose

Disaccharides: Double ring

1. Glucose + Fructose = Sucrose
2. Glucose + Galactose = Lactose
3. Glucose + Glucose = Maltose 
	
	
Polysacchardies: 2+ rings

1. Starches - Sugar storage in plants
2. Fibers - Makes plant cell walls, leaves, blabla (Indigestible for humans) : Needed for 3 things (Bowel movements, Lower cholesterol, Feel full) 
3. Glycogen - Sugar storage in animals (Human liver)
    -> Composed of hundreds of branched chains of glucose
	
]
	- Fats (Lipids)[
	Purpose: 
	- Energy 
	- Vitamin absoprtion
	- Insulation
	- compoment of cell membrane
	- Made into hormones 

Types
1. Triglycerides (3  fatty acid chains) : Glycerol + C and H chains
2. Saturated / Unsaturated fats : Solid/liquid at room temp
3. Trans-fats: Harmful type of unsaturated fats -> Raises levels of bad cholesterol, lowers levels of good cholesterol
	
	
	
] 
	- Protein [
	Purpose:
	- Enzymes
	- Cell structures
]

Important MICRONUTRIENTS{
	- |Amino acids|: Building blocks of protein -> Help together by peptide bonds (together they are called polypeptides) 
	  -> protein = long chains of different amino acids (There are 20 common ones) -> We can make 12, 8 other needs to be obtained
	  Chemical structure: Amino group + carboxylic acid group + variable R group (The general structure is shared amongst all amino acids)
	  
	- |Vitamins|: Organic molecules that contain C, H, O
	  Water soluble (B, C) -> Are not stored, so we need a constant supply
	  Fat soluble (A, D, E, K) -> Are stored in fat tissue, so overdose is possible 
	  
	- |Minerals|: Elements 
}
}


ENZYMES

- |Enzyme|: A protein that speeds up chemical reactions in the body
		-> Without these, reactions would happen too slow and we would die
		-> Require very specific temperature and PH range to function (Otherwise they become "DENATURED")
		
How do they work?

- Every enzyme has a specific shaped hole 
- There are certain substrates that fit in those holes

1. The substrate fills the enzyme
2. The enzyme causes the substrate to break down into products
3. The products are release
And the process begins again with another substrate 
!note that they can also bind substrates together to form larger products (This is how proteins are built from ammino acids) 

Examples
1. Amylase in saliva -> Breaks down starch into maltose
2. Lipases -> Breaks down lipids
3. Protases -> Breaks down proteins
